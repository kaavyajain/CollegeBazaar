          <h2>CollegeBazaar <br><span>   Buy, Sell and Borrow!</span></h2>
          <p>Online buying and selling has become one of the most popular trends around the
            world. As students at a residential college on the outskirts of town, we frequently
            require products that we must purchase from online eCommerce platforms, which
            are costly and also charge us a significant delivery fee. So, let's adopt "ReCommerce" and use the platform of COLLEGEBAZAAR to buy, sell and borrow things as we need from the SNU community!
